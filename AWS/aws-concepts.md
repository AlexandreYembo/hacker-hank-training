# AWS (Amazon Web Services) - Concepts

## Cloud terminology

### High Avaialabilty
When you have backups on clould and you can use in diferent places and devices such as: Mobile, Work Computer, Home computer, etc.

### Fault Tolerant
When you keep the files in your computer and the drive fails then your files just gone.
But if the file is up in the cloud and it's backed up on multiple services then that file can become corrupt or the cloud server that it is currently stored on can fail and there will always be another copy for you to access.
#### Basically something go wrong.

### Scalability
When your users' system are growing, e.g. from 1000 to 4000, and you can add quickly more server, you can scale up extremelly easy.

### Elasticity
Mean you can grow but you can also shrink. Yon can go from 1000 to 4000 you can grow
But you can drop out  of 3000 users then you can pull back and you can shrink that down.


## Introduction - VPC

AWS -> VPC (Amazon EC2 - Computer Power, Amazon RDS - Database and Amazon S3 -Storage)

#### VPC -> Virtual Private Cloud
  Is your private section of AWS, where you can place AWS resources, and allow/restrict access to them.
E.g. Facebook (People access facebook, we have Your homepage, My homePage and Friend's home page) in that case we have (Your VPC, My VPC and Friend's VPC).
In which VPC we have AWS EC2, AWS RDS.

#### AWS EC2 ->  




##### AWS RDS ->

##### AWS S3 ->

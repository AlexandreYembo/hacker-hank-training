### DDD - Domain Driven Design
An appropriate model makes sense of information and focuses it on a problem.

A domain model is not particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey.

### Ingredients of effective modeling
1- Binding the model and the implementation.

2- Cultivating a language based on the model. (be un-ambiguously understood and without translation).

3- Developing a knowledge-rich model. (objects not only data schema, but have behavior and enforce rules).

4- Distilling the model. (equality is important. Concepts dropped when unecessary. When you have many equivalent with uneeded concepts linked  you need to follow a new model that destinguished the essencial concept so that other can be dropped).

5- Brainstorming and experimenting.




In the old Waterfall method the business experts talk to the analyst and the analyst have full responsibility to create the model and pass to the developer. They have no opportunity to learn from the Developer or gaim experience with ealy versions of software.

If the developers are not interested in the domain, they learn only what the application should do, not the principle behind it.

# Design Patterns

## Structural design patterns

### Adapter
  1- Makes things work after they are designed.
  2- Is retrofitted to make unrelated classes work together.
  3- Provides a different interface to its subject. Proxy provides the same interface. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.


### Bridge
  1- Makes them work before they are.
  2- Is designed up-front to let the abstraction and the implementation vary independently.

### Decorator
  1- Provides an enhanced interface.

### Proxy
  1- Provides the same interface. Adapter provides a different interface to its subject. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.


## Behavioral design patterns

# Design Patterns

## Structural design patterns

### Adapter
  1- Makes things work after they are designed.
  2- Is retrofitted to make unrelated classes work together.
  3- Provides a different interface to its subject. Proxy provides the same interface. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.
  4- Adapter is meant to change the interface of an existing object. Decorator enhances another object without changing its interface.

### Bridge
  1- Makes them work before they are.
  2- Is designed up-front to let the abstraction and the implementation vary independently.

### Decorator
  1- Provides an enhanced interface.
  2- Decorator enhances another object without changing its interface.
  3- Is more transparent to the application than an adapter is.
  4- Supports recursive composition, which is not possible with pure Adapters.

### Facade


### Proxy
  1- Provides the same interface. Adapter provides a different interface to its subject. Decorator provides an enhanced interface.

  1- Also known as 'Serverless Computing' or 'Function as a Service', FaaS.

  2- Is a Software Design Pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer.
  
  3- Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.

 2- Packaging, deployment, scalling all handled transparently.
 
 3- Scaling is handled automatically, assuming the function is stateless.

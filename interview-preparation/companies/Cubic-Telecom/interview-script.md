# Introduction:

#### Tell me about yourself?
First and foremost I am ```enthusiastic``` person who understand how is important my role. I take my work seriously and I am always looking to improve my skills and qualifications.

I strongly undertstand how is important to deliver an outstading quality of project for our customers, because without them, there would be no business and hence I would have no job.

I genuainely believe that there are 2 types of employee:
 - The first is someone who turns up (start) to work and does their job and  they can just pay their bills.
 - Second is someone who puts their all into their job, is totally commited and does all they can to help the employer to achieve their goals

 So, I am the second person and I believe that most of my roles that I've been working on before define it.


 #### Why should we hire you?
 I saw the job description and I fully believe that this is a role that I am looking for and it is because it shows how challenge is and that I could give all my endeavour to provide high standards and positive result for the company. In addiction, I am always looking forward for the employer goals and I would like to have a chance to work for the Cubic company and be part of this team that I believe that has new challenges everyday.
 Also these challenges when achieved provide a great result once there will have positive feedbacks from business department and also the customer satisfaction.
In addition, I am a proactive person who worked previously in a role that identitied an issue and I solved it.

#### Why do you want to work for us?
I have studied the product and business of Cubic Telecom and this impact me when I saw how it delivered such high technologies for the customers, by providing IOT and comunication for automotive industries and how it will grown along the year, when technologies change everyday. So it would be a great opportunity to be part of this team and how I could achieve the business's goal.


#### What are your Strenghts?

I have many positive qualities and attributes to bring to this role, but I believe my main strenghts keys are:

- I am enthusiastic and hard-working.

- I like helping others of my team.

- I am Proactive and commited with positive results.


#### What are you weaknesses?
So, related to my weakness, I have few weakness that I consider the main keys. They are:
- I cannot say "no". It is really hard to say no when someone of my team ask me for help. Sometimes there are dealines that I should not stop what I am working on to help someone, but I comprehend that I need to improve this weakness I've been working on this for long time, trying to say that I have an specific task to delivery and once I close this item down I can give some help. Sometimes if necessary I can stay later and help someone from my team to help them.

- I am impatient when projects don't achieve the dealine and it makes me unhappy because sometimes I think that I failed on details or in case of when I am impacted with an specific task. I know  that this is part of the software processing development. To avoid this I've being more critical in few datails, trying to ask more during the plannings, because it is an important meeting to have all details and hence helping to give proper estimation.


#### Where do you see yourself in the Future?
For the future I want to help the company from my first day by delivering features and see my job running in such technologies. I want to work for a team that will be part of the company's milestone. In such future I want to see the company growth.


#### Do you have any questions?
- What are the biggest challenges facing the company today?

- What are the plans for the company in the future, Is there are any plans to be partnership or develop such autopilot cars devices?

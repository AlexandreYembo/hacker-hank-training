# An Important Note about Route Observables
The implementation bellow is not necessary. Angular will do this for you regarding these route observables.

For this, you might to implement ```onDestroy``` lifecycle hook.
```ts
export class UserComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    user: {id: name, name: string };
    paramsSubscription: Subscription     
    constructor(private currentRoute: ActivatedRoute){ }
        
    ngOnInit(){
        this.user = {
            id: this.currentRoute.snapshot.params['id'], // <- takes from route/:id
            name: this.currentRoute.snapshot.params['name'],// <- takes from route/:id/:name
        }
    }
    this.paramsSubscription = this.route.params
        .subscribe(     //< This method will be called once the parameter change, not when you load your component.
           (params: Params) => { // < first parameters is more important. Basically whenever the parameters change.  
                                //It will be fired whenever new data is sent through that observable.
                this.user.id = params['id'];
                this.user.name = params['name'];
           }
        );
    ngOnDestroy(){
        this.paramsSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
}

```
where ```OnInit``` and ```OnDestroy``` import from ```'@angular/core'```

and  ```Subscription``` imports from ```'rxjs/Subscription'```.

Again, it is not necessary here, but it does not hurt to also do it manually too here.

# template-Driven
```html
<form> </form>
```
There is not form action (post/get) because there is no action for submit because the angular will handle this event.

```html
<input
    type="text"
    id="username
    ngModel
    name="username
>
```

Only declaring ```ngModel + name``` where ```name``` is the name of this control. It will be registered in this javascript representation of the form.

##### Submit the data
Rather than use ```submit``` from button use this:
```html
    <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm"> --> where f is a local reference
```
``` #f="ngForm"``` tells to angular that access the component and get the ngForm object.

In typescript:
```ts
    onSubmit(form: ngForm){ 
        console.log(form)
    }
```
Where ```ngForm``` imports from ```'@angular/forms'```.

##### Getting access to the form in Typescript code using @ViewChild
```ts
    @ViewChild('f') signupForm: ngForm;

    onSubmit()
    {
        console.log(this.signupForm);
    }
```

##### Submit the data with Validation
Since using template, you can only add them in the template, by using ```required``` or other kind of validation
```html
    <input
    type="text"
    required>
```
The next code implements required and also validation for email field format.
```html
    <input
    type="emil"
    required
    email>
```
##### Using the form state

```html
   <input
    type="emil"
    required
    email>
[disabled]="!f.valid">
```
it will disable the button if the form is invalid where ```f``` is the local variable defined on ```<form>```

##### Outputting validatation message
Adding the local refence and associate this with the ```ngModel``` will expose additional information to use it in the validation message.
```html
<input
type=Email
#email="ngModel">
<span *ngIf="!email.valid && email.touched"> Please enter a valid email! </span>
```
Where ```ngIf="!email.valid"``` will take from the local variable ```#email="ngModel"```. However the ```#email="ngModel"``` does not represent the ngModel at all, it will be represent by the ```name="model"``` attribute instead.


##### Setting the default value with ngMode property binding
By simply replace ```ngModel``` to ```[ngModel]``` as one way binding.
```html
    <input
    type="text"
    [ngModel]="'my default value'">
```

##### working with ngModelGroup
This feature can allow you to group the control and also implements validation by using local reference:
```html
<div 
ngModelGroup="myGroup"
#myGroup="ngModelGroup">
    <div>
         <input
        type="emil"
        required
        email>
    </div>
     <div>
         <input
        type="emil"
        required
        email>
    </div>
</div>

<span *ngIf="!myGroup.valid && myGroup.touched"> My Group is invalid! </span>
```

##### Set Value
```ts
@ViewChild('f') signupForm: ngForm;

loadData()
{
    this.sigupForm.setValue({
        myGroup: {
            username: 'alex',
            email: ''
        }
        gender: 'male'
    });
}
```
But even updating few input it will override the complete form and there is another approach that resolve this:
```ts
this.sigupForm.form.patchValue(
     myGroup: {
            username: 'alex',
        }
);
```
this will override only username input, not the whole form.

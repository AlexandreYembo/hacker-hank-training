# Guards
Basically functionality, logic, code which is executed before a route is loaded or once you want to leave a route

Example: You can defined permission to access specific route (authentication/permission).

### How to implement
You can create a new file, a service for authentication
```ts
@Injectable()
export class AuthGuardService implements CanActivate{
    constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router){}
    canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
        return this.authService.isAuthenticated() //<--- call your auth method.
                        .then((authenticated: boolean) => {
                                if(authenticated)
                                return true;
                                else{
                                    this.router.navigate(['/']);
                                }
                            });
    }

```
where ```CanActivate``` imports from ```'@angular/router'``` and ```Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean``` you define which type of returns you want.

then you need to define in ```app-routing-module.ts``` or wherever you defined your route and define which routes should bd protected buy this guard.
```ts
{ path: 'servers', canActivate: [myGuard] component: ServersComponent,
    children:[
        { path: ':id', component: ServerComponent },
        { path: ':id/edit', component: EditServerComponent }
    ] 
}
```
where your guard is imported from your file and ```canActivate``` allows you to define array of guards. Also, once you define a guard and you have children, it will be applied automatically for them.

You need to add one more configuration in ```app.module.ts```:
```ts
    providers:[myGuard]
```

### How to implement to protect Child(Nested) Routes
If you want to project children level you can use another interface ```canActivateChild```.
```ts
export class AuthGuardService implements CanActivate, CanActivateChild // <- this interface will protect child level
```
Also you have to implement this interface
```ts
canActivateChild(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean
```
and now you need to register in the route file using ```canActivateChild```:
```ts
 { path: 'servers', 
      canActivateChild:[AuthGuardService], //<-- guard for your service
      component: ServersComponent, 
      children:[
        { path: ':id', component: ServerComponent },
        { path: ':id/edit', component: EditServerComponent }
      ] 
    }
```
